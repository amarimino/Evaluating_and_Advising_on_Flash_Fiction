# Evaluating_and_Advising_on_Flash_Fiction
A prompt for feedback and guidance on writing world-class flash fiction.

### **An Explanation of the Writing Evaluation Prompt**

This prompt is designed as a tool to help writers of all levels hone their craft and elevate their storytelling. Its primary purpose is to provide a detailed evaluation and actionable advice on a piece of writing, specifically focusing on how to lift it to a professional, internationally recognized standard.

It's built on the idea that targeted feedback is essential for improvement. The prompt guides the AI to act as a constructive critic or a mentor, analyzing elements like plot, character development, pacing, and style to give the writer a clear path forward.

Below are some of the key features that make this prompt a flexible and user-friendly tool:

#### **1. Language Adaptability**

While the prompt itself is written in English, it is designed to be universally applicable to **any language**. You can submit your story in your native language and receive feedback in that same language.

You simply need to specify your preference in your request. For example, you can submit a story written in Japanese and add the instruction:

* "Please provide your evaluation and advice in Japanese."

The AI will then conduct its entire analysis and deliver its feedback in Japanese. This makes it a valuable tool for writers all over the world, regardless of their native tongue.

#### **2. You Control the Level of Critique**

The prompt allows you to define how strict or "tough" you want the feedback to be. You can customize the intensity of the critique to match your current needs, whether you're looking for gentle encouragement or a rigorous, professional review.

For example, you can ask for:
* **Gentle feedback:** "Please focus on what's working well and offer some light suggestions."
* **Balanced feedback:** "I'm looking for a balanced mix of praise and constructive criticism."
* **Strict feedback:** "Please be very critical. I want a strict evaluation as if from a professional editor."

This feature ensures that the feedback you receive is always helpful and appropriate for your stage in the writing process.

#### **3. Adjustable Response Length**

You can control the length and detail of the feedback you receive. The prompt includes a parameter (often written as `max_tokens`) that sets a limit on the response length.

* To receive a **long, detailed analysis**, you can increase this number. This will result in an in-depth review covering multiple aspects of your story.
* To receive a **short, concise summary**, you can decrease this number. This is useful if you just want quick takeaways or a bullet-point list of suggestions.

In essence, this prompt acts as a powerful and adaptable tool for writer development. It puts you in complete control of the type, tone, and depth of the feedback you receive, empowering you to improve your writing in a way that best suits your personal goals.
